# Predicting_Economic_Threshold_for_Crops
Using Machine Learning to predict economic threshold level for crops from pest damages.
Pests are harmful plants and animals that pose a threat to human concerns, especially 
in agriculture. We need to have a strict check on pest population to maximize the crop yields. 
Crops that constitute food, fiber, etc. are essential for human existence and thus their 
destruction poses a threat to humankind. Pest control is costly and brings many hazards 
with it, so pests need to be treated systematically. Thereâ€™s no need of control measures 
till the pests have reached Economic Threshold(ET).
